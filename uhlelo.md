idea is part and parcel of a private web, or an archive of a subset of the internet, only the things that you have personally filtered or those that you trust have filtered.  there will be both a link and a copy of the content from a discreet point in time.  most of the things logged will be static pages, dynamic services like games will not be archived.  since content changes over time, it's good to take a snapshot of the data which prevents unfiltered info from getting in, though a link to the latest pages is provided as reference.

there is an element of social, form groups with family, friends, colleagues, share filtered content from the web, this content becomes the subset of the internet of material to search and read from, it grows over time.  bad material or material of little interest gets filtered out, so essentially you're creating a utopian web.  there can be different groups since no one is an exact replica of you, there will always be content that you think is not that good, but others think are good, so you will have different groups and different subsets to search from.  take an example as your family group, in the family group you can filter good content about health, or assets like photos, videos, these are things you only want to share with your family.

google's whole theory was that it wanted a scalable way to index the web, ie automated, this is a bit laborious and manual compared to the google method, but the process of recommending content can provide a little bit of automation.  i still want readers to filter content.

if you break down the web's benefits, it's about content, text, photos, videos, audio, etc.  entertainment i would classify as a different subset.

how does this all get stored?  where does it get stored?  what are the rules of joining and unjoining content, who ultimately gets to decide what content gets into these circles?
